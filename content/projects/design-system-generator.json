    "summary": "A comprehensive tool for creating and maintaining consistent design systems for digital products, streamlining the process from design to implementation.",
    "description": "The Design System Generator is a comprehensive tool for creating and maintaining consistent design systems for digital products. It provides an intuitive interface for generating typography scales, color palettes, spacing systems, and component tokens—all exportable to various formats for immediate implementation in projects.",
    "outcomes": [
      "Reduced design system setup time by 70%",
      "Created consistent brand identities across platforms",
      "Improved designer-developer collaboration",
      "Ensured accessibility compliance with contrast testing"

    "challenge": "Design systems are essential for consistent digital products, but creating and maintaining them is often a complex, time-consuming process. Teams struggle with generating comprehensive design tokens, ensuring consistency across platforms, and translating design decisions into implementation code. This leads to design drift, inefficient workflows, and inconsistent user experiences.",
    "solution": "The Design System Generator provides an all-in-one solution that automates the creation of design tokens across typography, colors, spacing, and component styles. It offers an intuitive visual interface for designers and developers to collaborate on design decisions, preview the results in real-time, and export to multiple code formats including CSS variables, SCSS, Tailwind config, and JSON for seamless implementation.",
