  "challenge": "StyleShop's existing platform was struggling with slow performance, poor mobile experience, and a complicated checkout process leading to high cart abandonment rates. Their product catalog had grown to over 5,000 items, making search and filtering capabilities critical. Additionally, they needed better integration with their inventory management system.",
  "solution": "We developed a custom headless e-commerce solution using Next.js for the frontend and Sanity CMS for content management. The new platform features a responsive design optimized for mobile shopping, an intuitive product filtering system, and a streamlined one-page checkout process integrated with Stripe for secure payments. We implemented server-side rendering and image optimization to dramatically improve load times.",
