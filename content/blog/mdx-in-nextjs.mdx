# Getting Started with MDX in Next.js

MDX is a powerful format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

## Why MDX?

- Write Markdown with JSX
- Import and use React components
- Create interactive blog posts
- Style your content with Tailwind CSS

## Example Component

Here's how you can use a React component in your MDX:

```jsx
import { Alert } from '@/components/ui/alert'

<Alert>
  This is a custom alert component in MDX!
</Alert>
```

## Next Steps

1. Create more MDX files
2. Add custom components
3. Style your content
4. Deploy your site
