# Getting Started with Next.js and MDX

Next.js

<CustomLink href="https://nextjs.org">Next.js Docs</CustomLink>


Next.js has become the go-to framework for building React applications, especially when you want a mixture of static and server-rendered pages. Combined with MDX (Markdown with JSX), it creates a powerful platform for content-heavy websites.

<pre className="language-javascript">
{`function example() {
  console.log("Direct usage");
  return true;
}`}
</pre>

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you write JSX embedded inside Markdown. This means you can:

- Use React components directly in your content
- Create interactive blog posts
- Maintain the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React

<Callout type="info">
  MDX is perfect for technical blogs where you want to include interactive demos alongside your content.
</Callout>

## Setting Up Your Project

Let's start by creating a new Next.js project with MDX support:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-blog
cd my-blog
npm install next-mdx-remote gray-matter
```

### Creating the MDX Configuration

The first step is to set up the configuration to parse and render MDX files:

```typescript
// lib/mdx/mdx-config.ts
import path from 'path';
import fs from 'fs';
import matter from 'gray-matter';
import { compileMDX } from 'next-mdx-remote/rsc';

// Your configuration continues...
```

## Creating Custom Components

One of the best things about MDX is the ability to use custom components. Let's create a custom callout component:

![Alt text](/path/to/image.jpg)



## Building Blog Features

A good blog needs features like:

1. Pagination
2. Categories and tags
3. Related posts
4. Search functionality

Let's implement a simple pagination system:

```tsx
function Pagination({ currentPage, totalPages }) {
  return (
    <div className="flex justify-center mt-12">
      <div className="flex space-x-2">
        {Array.from({ length: totalPages }, (_, i) => i + 1).map((page) => (
          <a
            key={page}
            href={`/blog?page=${page}`}
            className={`px-4 py-2 rounded ${
              currentPage === page
                ? 'bg-primary text-primary-foreground'
                : 'bg-muted hover:bg-muted/80'
            }`}
          >
            {page}
          </a>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Image Optimization

Next.js has built-in image optimization with the `Image` component:
<Image 
  src="/images/next-architecture.png" 
  alt="Next.js Architecture Diagram" 
  caption="Next.js 14 architecture showing server and client components" 
/>


### Code Splitting

Next.js automatically code-splits your application by routes. This means users only download the code they need for the current page.

## Deploying Your Blog

When you're ready to go live, you have several options:

1. **Vercel** - The easiest option, with seamless integration
2. **Netlify** - Great for static sites with some serverless functions
3. **Self-hosted** - More control, but requires more setup

<Callout type="success">
  Deploying to Vercel is as simple as connecting your GitHub repository and clicking deploy!
</Callout>

## Advanced MDX Techniques

Once you're comfortable with the basics, you can explore:

- Custom rehype/remark plugins
- Dynamic imports for components
- Nested layouts for different post types

## Conclusion

Building a blog with Next.js and MDX gives you the perfect balance of developer experience, performance, and flexibility. You get to write content in Markdown while having the full power of React at your fingertips.

In the next article, we'll explore how to add advanced features like comments, analytics, and newsletter subscriptions.

Happy coding!
