# Getting Started with Next.js and TypeScript

Next.js and TypeScript are a powerful combination for building modern web applications. In this guide, we'll explore how to set up a new project and implement some common patterns.

<Callout type="info" title="Prerequisites">
  To follow along with this tutorial, you should have Node.js installed (version 14 or higher) and a basic understanding of React.
</Callout>

## Why TypeScript with Next.js?

TypeScript adds static type checking to JavaScript, which helps catch errors during development rather than at runtime. When combined with Next.js, you get:

1. Better developer experience with autocomplete
2. Fewer bugs in production
3. Self-documenting code
4. Improved refactoring capabilities

## Setting Up a New Project

Let's start by creating a new Next.js project with TypeScript:



This command creates a new Next.js project with TypeScript configuration already set up for you.

## Creating Type-Safe API Routes

One of the advantages of using TypeScript with Next.js is the ability to create type-safe API routes:



<Callout type="warning" title="Important">
  Always validate and sanitize input data, especially from API routes, to prevent security vulnerabilities.
</Callout>

## Working with Data Fetching

Next.js provides several methods for data fetching, and with TypeScript, we can make them type-safe:



## Conclusion

Next.js and TypeScript provide a robust foundation for building modern web applications. By leveraging the type safety of TypeScript with the powerful features of Next.js, you can create performant, maintainable, and scalable applications.

In future posts, we'll explore more advanced topics like:

- Custom TypeScript configurations
- State management with TypeScript
- Performance optimization techniques
- Deployment strategies
