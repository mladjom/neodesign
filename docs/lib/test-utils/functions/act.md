# Function: act()

Simply calls React.act(cb)
If that's not available (older version of react) then it
simply calls the deprecated version which is ReactTestUtils.act(cb)

## Call Signature

> **act**(`callback`): `void`

Defined in: node\_modules/@testing-library/react/types/index.d.ts:280

Wrap any code rendering and triggering updates to your components into `act()` calls.

Ensures that the behavior in your tests matches what happens in the browser
more closely by executing pending `useEffect`s before returning. This also
reduces the amount of re-renders done.

### Parameters

#### callback

() => `VoidOrUndefinedOnly`

A synchronous, void callback that will execute as a single, complete React commit.

### Returns

`void`
